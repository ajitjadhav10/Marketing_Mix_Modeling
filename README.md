# Marketing Mix Modeling

What are MMMs?
- MMMs are statistical models used to measure the effectiveness of advertising spend.

MMMs use historical sales data to predict sales, based on advertising variables and some control variables like weather, seasonality and market competition. At the base of it, MMMs are regression models which are used to answer causal questions like **What was the ROAS of Google Ads?** where the cause is the amount spent on google ads and the ROAS is the effect.
